Husky is a tool that allows us to manage **Git Hooks** which are scripts that we automate to run on key Git
repository actions such as committing/pushing.

Usage of pre-commit hooks is controversial among developers because they slow down commits and can hinder developers
who prefer regularly committing small pieces of code at a time. For this reason it is important to prioritize speed
of the pre-commit hooks by limiting the actions performed by them. Using the [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged)
tool allows us to run things like formatters/linters only on files that have been staged rather than the whole codebase.
