The main benefits Tailwind CSS offers is speed and co-location:

1. Speed - Styling a component requires much less typing

2. Co-location - The CSS stays in the same place as the JSX/HTML so there is no need to context switch between
   two files

## Learning Tailwind

The best way to learn Tailwind CSS is to just start using it in a project. Keep the Tailwind CSS documentation
open and search for the CSS property you need as you go. Using the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension on VSCode
will speed up the process even more.
