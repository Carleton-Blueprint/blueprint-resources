## Why use ESLint

**Catch bugs early** – ESLint spots things like accidental assignments in conditionals `(if (a = b))`, which might run but do the wrong thing.

**Maintain consistency** – Especially important in teams, ESLint enforces a common style, so the codebase looks like it was written by one person.

**Save time during code reviews** – Reviewers can focus on logic, not missing spaces or messy formatting.

**Better developer experience** – Tools like VS Code integrate ESLint into the editor, so you get live feedback as you code.

## Configuration

ESLint has tons of configuration options and can be customized with general or path specific rules and overrides to meet the needs of a given project.
You can define error levels specific rules and add third party plugins with more options. ESLint can be very daunting with its many configuration
options so I recommend you start with their recommended configuration and setup rules and overrides as you go.
