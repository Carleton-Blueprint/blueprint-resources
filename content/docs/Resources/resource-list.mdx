## Value Proposition of Tools

### Pre-Commits

- Helps you keep up standards for EACH commit
- Making sure that code stays clean according to your own standards
- Ex. don’t have console.log() everywhere
- catches formatting/linting issues before CI so you don’t have to make another commit to fix

### CI/CD

- Unit/Integration Tests
  - Less value, but helps you ensure that your business logic is sounds
  - Sometimes other ppls refactors can break your code, so you want to make sure that the edge-cases are still standing
- End-to-End tests
  - Helps you see the main control flows of your codebase
  - Beyond testing, it helps you plan out the features
