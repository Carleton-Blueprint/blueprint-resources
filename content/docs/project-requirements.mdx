title: Project Requirements
---

This checklist should be used to setup projects for Blueprint. Setting up these tools at the beginning of the project will save the developers from having to do repetitive tasks. It also will ensure some good practices and clean/structured code. The Tech Team can take on the responsibility to ensure that teams don’t run into any problems setting these things up during the “Tech Team infiltration”.

## TypeScript

Use TypeScript over JavaScript to catch errors earlier and save all sorts of headaches with type safety

## Prettier + ESLint

Use ESLint and Prettier to ensure a well formatted, clean codebase with configurations that you feel empower you the most (Or use our recommended configurations)

## Husky pre-commit hook

Use Husky pre-commit hooks to ensure no problematic or unformatted code gets pushed to remote.

## Pull request templates + issue templates

Use templates for your PRs/issues to maintain a structured documentation of your problems and solutions.
