title: Types vs Interfaces

Always prefer types instead of interfaces when working on Blueprint projects. This [video by Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFo2z8ILNo) explains why:

```ts
// Prefer this
type Props = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
// Avoid this
interface Props {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// valid
type Props = string | number;
// invalid
interface Props = string | number;
```

Here is a table comparing types vs interfaces
| Feature | `type` | `interface` |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Purpose** | Defines a type alias for any valid type | Describes the shape of an object or class |
| **Intersection** | ✅ Use `&` for intersection | ✅ Use `extends` keyword |
| **Union** | ✅ Fully supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Declaration Merging** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Supported |
| **Implements (Classes)** | ✅ Can be used with `implements` | ✅ Can be used with `implements` |
| **Tuple and Primitive Types** | ✅ Can define tuples, primitives, etc. | ❌ Only used for object shapes |
| **Computed Properties** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Use in Complex Types** | ✅ Very flexible with all kinds of types | ❌ Limited to object-like structures |

The only function interfaces serve that types cannot do better is **declaration merging**. Declaration merging is when members of two interfaces
declarations are merged under a single name. This happens when an interface is declared under the same name as a previously defined one. For example:

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  job: string;
  salary: string;
}

interface User {
  gender: string;
  isMarried: boolean;
}

const user: User = {
  id: 3,
  name: 'Abdul Shakur',
  job: 'software developer',
  salary: $4000,
  gender: 'male',
  isMarried: true,
};
```

Declaration merging may be desirable in certain cases but if the developer is not familiar with it then it may cause confusion.
