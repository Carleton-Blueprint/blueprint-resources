title: Absolute Imports
---

`tsconfig.json` allows us to configure a variety of options related to how the TypeScript compiler
processes your code. One of these options is called `paths` which allows us to "re-map imports to
lookup locations relative to the baseUrl if set, or the tsconfig file itself otherwise" ([TypeScript
docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#paths)).

A common use case of this is option is setting up absolute imports:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This allows us to import from the `src` directory in a cleaner way

```ts
import MyComponent from "@/components/MyComponent"
// instead of
import MyComponent from ../../../components/MyComponent"
```

You might be inclined to add other paths to the `tsconfig.json` as well.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
      "@Components/*": ["./src/components/*"]
      "@Lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
