title: Why TypeScript?
---

The primary reason to use TypeScript over JavaScript is to catch issues in your code at compile time instead of runtime.

## The Problem

The following JavaScript code will compile and run with no issues:

```js
function sumList(list) {
  let total = 0;
  for (num of list) {
    total += num;
  }
  return total;
}

const list = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const total = sumList(list);
console.log(total); // > 10
```

What if we passed an object instead of a list? The code would still compile but it would throw and error during runtime:

```js
const list = { example: '1' };
const total = sumList(list);
console.log(total);
/*
^ Throws:
TypeError: list2 is not iterable
    at sumList (<anonymous>:13:18)
    at <anonymous>:22:9
    at mn (<anonymous>:16:5455)
*/
```

Obviously this is problematic for many reasons, the biggest being we only encounter the error during runtime.
To avoid running into errors during runtime, code needs to be thoroughly tested to cover a variety of use cases.

The way we have named variables/parameters has also led us to make assumptions about their values.
A parameter named "list" would be reasonably assumed to be an iterable list and therefore used in a for loop.
These errors are problematic but what about the following example:

```js
const list = ['1', '2', '3', '4'];
const total = sumList(list);
console.log(total); // > "01234"
```

This example demonstrates a far more dangerous possibility: The code compiles and runs without error but it does not work as expected.
Although this example seems pretty harmless, you can imagine a mistake like this can have catastrophic consequences.

## What is the solution?

So what is the solution to this issue? Your first thought might be to perform validation on our parameters.

### Validate types manually

Performing validation on our variables before we pass them in can be difficult. You might have noticed I stopped including the function definition
in my later examples, this is because more often than not function definitions will abstracted into different files or imported from libraries. How
do we validate if we don't know what we are validating for?

Performing validation on our parameters inside of the function is an option. The problem is performing validation can get complicated quick if the
parameter types are anything more than primitives. For example we can validate that the parameter is an iterable in our earlier example, and maybe
even validate that it is a list, but what happens when we input `[1, "2", 3, "4"]`? Now we need to validate each element too?

We also run into the same set of issues when we return a value from our function: the value we return must be validated on the outside. None of our code can
trust code that is out of its scope, and when we make a change in the code we now have to go back and update all of our validation. This is a huge waste of
time and makes our code less maintainable.

### Use TypeScript

TypeScript allows us to define types for our variables and parameters and will throw errors if we try to use them in unexpected ways. In our previous
example TypeScript will complain if we don't define a type for the parameter telling us `Parameter 'list' implicitly has an 'any' type`. Let's specify
the type and look at the code:

```ts
function sumList(list: number[]) {
  let total = 0;
  for (num of list) {
    total += num;
  }
  return total;
}

const list = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const total = sumList(list);
console.log(total); // > 10

const notAList = { example: '1' };
const total = sumList(notAList);
/* 
^ Throws a compile time error (our IDE can catch these and give us a red underline):
Argument of type '{ example: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number[]'
*/
```

How does TypeScript know what types `list` and `notAList` are when we haven't specified them? Type inference.

Type inference is what makes TypeScript so powerful and easy to use. In the following code:

```ts
const num = 5;
```

TypeScript can infer the type of num implicitly (as opposed to our explicitly defined type in the sumList parameter). Anytime TypeScripts type inference is
unable to infer a type we get an error for implicitly using 'any' type. This happened with the parameter of the function so we specified that it was of type
`number[]`. Type inference is amazing because it means we don't have to explicitly define the types of each of our variables like we do in other statically
typed languages like Java.

TypeScript helps us catch type related errors earlier on and helps us avoid unintended side effects that may arise due to mismatched types.
